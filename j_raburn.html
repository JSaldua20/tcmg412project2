I have a passion for traveling and I am constantly looking for new places to go. Recently, I went to Salt Lake City (SLC), Utah in Decemeber 2020 and Arizona/Utah in January 2021. The landscaping in these areas are so much different than our flat home of Texas. I experienced so many new things in Utah, like how flat SLC is, but the surrounding areas have such tall mountains. I got to see snow for the first time in six years, frozen waterfalls, hiking in snow/ice, BYU and UUtah, exploring downtown SLC, and Arches National Park. On my second trip, we road tripped 18 hours, and went to so many amazing parks like Horseshoe Bend, Lake Powell, Zion National Park (TWICE!), The Lone Rock, and so many cool last minute excursions. I am planning on going to Colorado soon and also Banff, Alberta in May! Here are a few pictures from my trips!
