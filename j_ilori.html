<h1 align="center">Overuse Injuries</h1>
<p>Year round participation in sports are causing children to experience more injuries. Most youth athletes used to play multiple sports, which prevented injuries in the long run.

Overtime, these minor issues can turn into serious injuries if they are not dealt with in time.</p>
