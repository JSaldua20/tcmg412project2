<p>	Why Reveille is better than all other dogs.

Reveille is the first lady of Aggieland. She leads the Texas A&M band onto the field during every game.
Originally, Reveille had free reign of A&M's campus, but now she is cared for by a Mascot Corporal.
She is escorted by the Mscot Corporal to all functions and Aggie engagements.
The biggest reason why Reville is better than any other dog, is she is the highest-ranking member in the Corps of Cadets and wears five silver diamonds.
She is far greater, that if Reveille falls asleep on a cadets bed, they must find a different place to sleep since she outranks them.
Reveille also controls classrooms, if she barks, then the class ends because she thinks it is boring.
