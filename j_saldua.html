<center><p>The state of Texas has one of the richest and deepest histories of all the states that make up the United States of America.
Texas was first settled by the Spainiards in the 1500. Over the next 300 years theyr will go from being a part of Spainish, French and independant Mexican territory.
In 1835 however, they began a revolution that resulted in the independence of the Republic of Texas in 1836.
For the next 10 years until 1845 Texas remains an independant republic until 1845 when they become a state in the USA.
