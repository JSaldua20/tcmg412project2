Texas was first settled by the Spainiards in the 1500. Over the next 300 years theyr will go from being a part of Spainish, French and independant Mexican territory.
In 1835 however, they began a revolution that resulted in the independence of the Republic of Texas in 1836.
For the next 10 years until 1845 Texas remains an independant republic until 1845 when they become a state in the USA.
